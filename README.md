# Newsletter-Website
Website which signs you up to a dummy newsletter using MVC in asp.net

When you submit all criteria correctly, your record is added to the database, and an email is sent to the email address entered; sending a welcome message to notify the user.

Feedback is given to the user if the data fields are not filled in correctly via an error message once a request is sent to the server.
