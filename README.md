# Newsletter-Website
Website which signs you up to a dummy newsletter using MVC in ASP.NET

When you submit all criteria correctly, your record is added to the database, and an email is sent to the email address entered; sending a welcome message to notify the user.

Feedback is given to the user if the data fields are not filled in correctly via error messages once a request is sent to the server. If the email being entered already exists in the database, then the user will be shown a new screen notifying them that their email address has already been signed up and cannot be entered again.

Required fields include how you heard about us, email address, and name.

The Target framework used for the project in Visual Studio is .NET Framework 4.6.1
